"""job — the sufferer's guilt / victim-blaming (the Book of Job).

Atoms:  j = the world repays by deeds   (the theory — unverified)
        s = he suffers                  (observed fact — T)
        g = he is guilty                (hidden — unverified)

The friends' machine, run cell by cell: the inference is honest, the fuel
is credit, and the guilty verdict is a STIPULATION that saves a dying
theory — not an observation. Job vs the friends = the lazy register vs
the greedy one. Modern name of the machine: the just-world fallacy /
victim-blaming. The book's own ending grades the parties (42:7).
